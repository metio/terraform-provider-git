# git_log (Data Source)

Fetches the commit log of a Git repository similar to `git log`.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# get commit logs of repository
data "git_log" "log" {
  directory = "/path/to/git/repository"
}

# filter commits to certain paths
data "git_log" "filtered" {
  directory    = "/path/to/git/repository"
  filter_paths = ["some/directory/in/repository/*", "README.md"]
}

# read commit info for each commit from log
data "git_commit" "from_log" {
  for_each  = toset(data.git_log.filtered.commits)
  directory = "/path/to/git/repository"
  revision  = each.value
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `directory` (String) The path to the local Git repository.

### Optional

- `all` (Boolean) Pretend as if all the refs in `refs/`, along with `HEAD`, are listed. It is equivalent to running `git log --all`. If set on true, the `from` attribute will be ignored.
- `filter_paths` (List of String) Show only commits that are enough to explain how the files that match the specified paths came to be. Note that these are not Git `pathspec` but rather Go [path matchers](https://pkg.go.dev/path#Match) thus you have to add `/*` for directories yourself.
- `from` (String) When set the log will only contain commits reachable from it. If this option is not set, `HEAD` will be used as the default. Can be any [revision](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/gitrevisions) that `go-git` [supports](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-git/go-git/v5#Repository.ResolveRevision).
- `max_count` (Number) Limit the number of commits to output.
- `order` (String) The traversal algorithm to use while listing commits. Defaults to `time` which is similar to `git log`. Other values are `depth` and `breadth` for depth- or breadth-first traversal.
- `since` (String) Show commits more recent than a specific date. Date must be in RFC 3339 format, e.g. by using the built-in [timestamp](https://www.terraform.io/language/functions/timestamp)/[timeadd](https://www.terraform.io/language/functions/timeadd) functions.
- `skip` (Number) Skip first number of commits in output.
- `until` (String) Show commits older than a specific date. Date must be in RFC 3339 format, e.g. by using the built-in [timestamp](https://www.terraform.io/language/functions/timestamp)/[timeadd](https://www.terraform.io/language/functions/timeadd) functions.

### Read-Only

- `commits` (List of String) The resulting commits ordered as by the `order` attribute.
- `id` (String) The same value as the `directory` attribute.
