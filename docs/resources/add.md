# git_add (Resource)

Add file contents to the index using `git add`.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# add single file
resource "git_add" "file" {
  directory  = "/path/to/git/repository"
  exact_path = "path/to/file/in/repository"
}

# add all files in directory and its subdirectory recursively
resource "git_add" "directory" {
  directory  = "/path/to/git/repository"
  exact_path = "path/to/directory/in/repository"
}

# add files matching pattern
resource "git_add" "glob" {
  directory = "/path/to/git/repository"
  glob_path = "path/*/in/repo*"
}

# add all modified files
resource "git_add" "all" {
  directory = "/path/to/git/repository"
  all       = true
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `directory` (String) The path to the local Git repository.

### Optional

- `all` (Boolean) Update the index not only where the working tree has a file matching `exact_path` or `glob_path` but also where the index already has an entry. This adds, modifies, and removes index entries to match the working tree. If no paths are given, all files in the entire working tree are updated. Defaults to `true`.
- `exact_path` (String) The exact filepath to the file or directory to be added. Conflicts with `glob_path`.
- `glob_path` (String) The glob pattern of files or directories to be added. Conflicts with `exact_path`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The same value as the `directory` attribute.
